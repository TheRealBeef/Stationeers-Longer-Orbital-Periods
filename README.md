## Compatibility ##

This mod is compatible with existing saves and will not corrupt them when you install or uninstall the mod 
However, you may find yourself struggling if your current save is heavily reliant on solar energy and the night
just began...

However, it could interfere with other plugin based mods that alter the orbital period
